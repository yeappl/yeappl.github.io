Highlights
=====
* A cohort of 133 head & neck cancer patients treated with TomoTherapy was examined.
* Differences between planned and delivered maximum spinal cord dose were small.
* Substantial weight loss and anatomical change during treatment was observed.
* No link between weight loss or anatomical change, and dose differences was seen.

Abstract
===== 

Background and purpose: The impact of weight loss and anatomical change during head and neck (H&N) radiotherapy on spinal cord dosimetry is poorly understood, limiting evidence-based adaptive management strategies.

Materials and methods: 133 H&N patients treated with daily mega-voltage CT image-guidance (MVCT-IG) on TomoTherapy, were selected. Elastix software was used to deform planning scan SC contours to MVCT-IG scans, and accumulate dose. Planned (DP) and delivered (DA) spinal cord D2% (SCD2%) were compared. Univariate relationships between neck irradiation strategy (unilateral vs bilateral), T-stage, N-stage, weight loss, and changes in lateral separation (LND) and CT slice surface area (SSA) at C1 and the superior thyroid notch (TN), and ΔSCD2% [(DA – DP) D2%] were examined.

Results: The mean value for (DA – DP) D2% was −0.07 Gy (95%CI −0.28 to 0.14, range −5.7 Gy to 3.8 Gy), and the mean absolute difference between DP and DA (independent of difference direction) was 0.9 Gy (95%CI 0.76–1.04 Gy). Neck treatment strategy (p = 0.39) and T-stage (p = 0.56) did not affect ΔSCD2%. Borderline significance (p = 0.09) was seen for higher N-stage (N2-3) and higher ΔSCD2%. Mean reductions in anatomical metrics were substantial: weight loss 6.8 kg; C1LND 12.9 mm; C1SSA 12.1 cm2; TNLND 5.3 mm; TNSSA 11.2 cm2, but no relationship between weight loss or anatomical change and ΔSCD2% was observed (all r2 < 0.1).

Conclusions: Differences between delivered and planned spinal cord D2% are small in patients treated with daily IG. Even patients experiencing substantial weight loss or anatomical change during treatment do not require adaptive replanning for spinal cord safety.
